## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a stream-of-consciousness passage from the perspective of Mei, the daughter returned from London, as she observes Ling in the garden. Let her graphs and theories collide with the raw, un-theorized reality before her.
- Compose a pantun (a traditional Malay poetic form) that Ling's grandmother might have recited, encoding a message about land, loss, or resistance.
- Narrate a single day at the rubber processing plant from the foreman's perspective. How does he justify the 'flick of the wrist' that dismisses Ling's father?
- Describe the history of the 'Big House' from the point of view of its walls, its floorboards, or its colonial-era plumbing. What has it seen change, and what has remained stubbornly the same?

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Debt Visualization' tool that maps the cascading debts mentioned in Chapter 1 (grain -> shop -> wholesaler -> bank). Allow users to input their own 'units' and see the chain of dependency rendered as a network graph or a sinking landscape.
- Create a text generator that mimics the novel's prose style: short, sensory, metaphor-rich sentences that blend multiple languages and layers of economic reality. Train it on the provided opening to produce new paragraphs describing other spaces in the town.
